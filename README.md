# IFC Study Trove
Welcome to the Study Trove! This repo contains everything you need to ace each block test. Each Infomap is painstakingly extracted from the lessons—condensed and organized by learning objective. Each practice test is generated to cover all learning objectives and target multiple levels of understanding from rote definition to conceptual knowledge and application.

# Recommended Usage

Master each block with 3 easy steps!

1. **Pretrain:** Review the Infomap. It’s meant to be a fast and easy read. If anything is confusing, refer to the course slides, the instructor, or Claude for clarification.
2. **Train:** Take a practice test with the Infomap. Any time you need to use the Infomap, mark the question so you can study it later.
3. **Test:** Take a different practice test without the Infomap. This will give you a better gauge of your actual test performance. The third practice test is optional.
